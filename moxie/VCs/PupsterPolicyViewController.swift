The Services
Pupster is a platform where Seekers can view dog training content and connect with Experts via Consultations in order to request information and advice. If you wish to use the Services, create a new Consultation, or post a Listing, you must first register to create a Pupster Account (as defined below).

The Company’s role is solely to facilitate the availability of the Site, Applications and Services and to provide services related thereto, such as Consultation facilitation and payment integration. The Company does not provide and is not responsible for User Content or any information or advice exchanged between Users during Consultations or otherwise. You understand and acknowledge that Experts are not employees or agents of the Company, but are independent service providers using the Site, Applications and Services to market their expertise to Seekers and the public.

Consultations should not be intended for nutritional, fitness or other health-related diagnosis, prescription or treatment, and you acknowledge you are the sole responsible for any loss or damage caused by reliance on information provided by Experts during the use of the Services.

All information provided through the Services is intended for general guidance only, and is not a substitute for the professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment by a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine who has actually examined an individual’s animal or possesses firsthand knowledge of an animal’s condition. Always seek the advice of your veterinarian or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on the Services. If you believe your pet may have a medical emergency, call your veterinarian immediately.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THE SITE, APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES ARE INTENDED MERELY TO FACILITATE USER INTERACTION. THE COMPANY CANNOT AND DOES NOT CONTROL OR GUARANTEE THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY LISTINGS, USER CONTENT OR THE INFORMATION EXCHANGED BETWEEN USERS VIA THE SERVICES. NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR THE RELEVANT EXPERT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR AND BOTH HEREBY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY AND ALL INFORMATION PROVIDED UNDER THE SERVICES. ACCORDINGLY, ALL USERS USE THE SITE, APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES AT THEIR OWN RISK.

User Account Registration
To access certain features of the Site and Applications, such as creating a Consultation and posting a Listing, you must register to create an account (“Pupster Account”) and become a User. You may register directly via the Site or Applications.

We will create your Pupster Account and your Pupster Account profile page for your use of the Site and Applications based upon the personal information you provide to us. You may not have more than one (1) active Pupster Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. The Company reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Pupster Account and your access to the Site, Applications and Services at any time, especially if you create more than one (1) Pupster Account or if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Pupster Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify the Company of any unauthorized use of your Pupster Account.

Listings (for Experts)
In order to complete your Pupster Account and offer your services to Seekers, you (as an Expert) must create a Listing. To this end, you may need to provide information regarding the expertise you offer as well as pricing and other financial terms applicable to your offering. Listings will be made available to Seekers via the Site, Applications and Services.

Seekers will be able to request Consultations with you via the Site, Applications and Services based upon the information provided in your Listing. You understand and agree that once a Seeker requests a Consultation, the price quoted under your Listing may not be altered for the duration of the Consultation.

You are solely responsible for all information posted in your Listing. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the agreements you enter into with Seekers (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties and (ii) will (a) comply with all applicable laws, Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to you and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that the Company assumes no responsibility for the content of Listings or for any User’s compliance with any applicable laws, rules and regulations.

You understand and agree that the Company is not involved in the interactions between Users and does not have any obligation to refer, endorse or recommend particular Experts to Seekers. You also understand and acknowledge that the Company does not endorse or guarantee User Content or the content of communications between Users.

The Company reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason or no reason, including Listings that the Company, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Site, Applications or Services. You are solely responsible for your own acts and omissions.

No Endorsement
The Company does not endorse any of its Users. In addition, although these Terms require Users to provide accurate information, we do not guarantee that we will attempt to confirm any User’s purported identity or credentials. You are responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others who you contact via the Site, Applications and Services.

By using the Site, Applications or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Users or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Users or other third parties who caused you harm and you agree not to attempt to impose liability on, or seek any legal remedy from the Company with respect to such actions or omissions.

Consultations and Financial Terms
Consultations and Financial Terms (for Experts)
If you (as an Expert) receive a Consultation request from a User, you will be able to either accept or reject the request within the specified time, as determined by the Company at its own discretion or, where appropriate, by the Seeker. Otherwise, the request will expire automatically. When a Consultation is requested to you via the Site, Applications and Services, we will grant you access to the Seeker’s Pupster Account profile page, so that you can view this information before confirming or rejecting the Consultation.

The amount due and payable by a Seeker relating each Consultation with you is referred to as the “Consultation Fee”. Consultation Fees are quoted in U.S. dollars. Please note that it is Experts, and not the Company, who set Consultation Fee Rates unilaterally.

In consideration of the Services, the Company charges you a fee (the “Service Fee”) based on a percentage of Consultation Fees collected on your behalf. The current applicable percentage is forty percent (40%). The Service Fee is deducted from the Consultation Fee payable to you in respect to a Consultation. At the conclusion of each Consultation, the Company calculates the appropriate Consultation Fee payable by the Seeker to you based on the applicable Consultation Fee Rate. After deducting the applicable Service Fee, the Company remits your share of the Consultation Fee to your Pupster Balance. Once you have reached the minimum withdrawal amount, which is currently fifty U.S. dollars ($50), you will be able to withdraw your earnings from your Pupster Balance and these earnings will be remitted to you via third party providers or such other payment methods as may be listed on the Site or via the Applications, in U.S. dollars. Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.

You represent and warrant that you are not bound by any existing agreement or arrangement that could conflict with these Terms or with the Services, and the Company takes no responsibility if your use of the Services lead to the infringement of any of the aforementioned agreements or arrangements.

We encourage you to reject all Consultations involving health-related diagnosis, prescriptions or treatments, as well as Consultations you consider to be outside your field of expertise.

Consultations and Financial Terms (for Seekers)
You (as a Seeker), not the Company, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed Consultations. If you choose to interact with an Expert via the Site or Applications, these Terms and other terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Consultation as set out in the Listing may apply. Experts have no obligation whatsoever to accept your Consultations and you, not the Company, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements.

You also acknowledge that the information and advice provide by Experts within the Services constitutes their own personal opinion, and you, not the Experts or the Company, are the sole responsible for any loss or damage caused by voluntary reliance on such information and advice.

You agree to pay the Company all Consultation Fees due in connection with any Consultation. In order to initiate a Consultation, you understand and agree that the Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to obtain a pre-authorization of your credit card or charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one U.S. dollar ($1), in order to verify your credit card. At the end of each Consultation, the Company will process and collect the Consultation Fee payable in accordance with these Terms and the terms of the Listing. Please note that the Company cannot control any fees that may be charged to a User by his or her bank related to collection of the Consultation Fees by the Company, and the Company disclaims all liability in this regard.

In connection with your payment, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to the Company or its third party payment processor. You agree to pay the Company for any consummated Consultations in accordance with these Terms, by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Applications. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the Consultation by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Applications, either directly by the Company or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor. If you are directed to the Company’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and Privacy Statement before using the services.

If you have been improperly charged for a Consultation and believe you require a refund, please contact the Company at hello@thepupster.com. Refunds will be processed on a case-by-case basis.
